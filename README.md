## 1. Batik Recognition_Augmentation_V2_Plus_Manual_DataSet_VGG16.ipynb
This file contains the code for performing transfer learning using the VGG16 model on a dataset that includes manual data augmentation from the program "Prepare_the_Dataset.ipynb" and automatic augmentation during each epoch.

## 2. Batik Recognition_Augmentation_V2_Plus_Manual_DataSet_mobilenetV2.ipynb
This file contains the code for performing transfer learning using the MobileNetV2 model on a dataset that includes manual data augmentation from the program "Prepare_the_Dataset.ipynb" and automatic augmentation during each epoch.

## 3. Batik Recognition_Augmentation_V1_Auto_InceptionV3.ipynb
This file contains the code for performing transfer learning using the InceptionV3 model on a dataset without manual data augmentation. Only automatic augmentation is applied during each epoch.

## 4. PreParing_the_Dataset.ipynb
This file includes the program used to prepare the dataset for transfer learning, including the manual data augmentation process.
